# Installation and Setup

Download this repo to your local machine. Navigate to the root folder for both the backened and the client. Use your Terminal App to run the commands below.

You need to have the REST API Server and the App running together at the same time for the app to work.

## backend folder

1. Run the command `npm install` to install node_modules

The backend server is running locally, on port 3000 http://localhost:3000/

## client folder

1. Run the command `npm install` to install node_modules
2. Run the command `npm run start` to start the app

The client app is running locally, on port 5000 http://localhost:5000/

There is an online demo version of the app here https://dbz-database-client.herokuapp.com/
